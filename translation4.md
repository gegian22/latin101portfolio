When the Greeks were not able to conquer Troy for ten years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. 
They gathered Menelaus, Ulixēus, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus and put them in the horse. 
They worte on the horse "The Greeks give this horse as a gift to Minereva" and sent the military camp to Tenedos 
When the Trojans saw it, they thought the enemy had been sent away. Priamus ordered the horse to be taken to the temple of Minereva as a gift. 
When the prophet, Cassandra, saw the horse she said it containedthe enemy of state, but faith was not given to her. 
The Greeks got out of the horse and killed the gate keepers and conqured Troy.
